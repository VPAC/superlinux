MD3 - 
Aspirin to A2 phospholipase.  


Using the 1OXR phospholipase structure as a target, 4 aspirin molecules (parameterized at swissparam) 
were added to a solvated 64x64x64A system. 

In addition, to aspirin, the 1oxr system  also contains a calcium ion in the crystallographically 
determined binding position plus 0.15M NaCl. 

The system is originally optimized and equilibrated at 310K for 0.2 nano seconds under NPT conditions, 
before switching to NVT ensemble for 10 sequential loops of 10ns each. 

The aim of this experiment is to collect enough MD data to see if the aspirin molecules can associate 
into the crystallographically determined binding pocket. 

The first step requires RMSD fitting of the simulation trajectory so that the
protein structure is relative to the original starting position. 
-Next we require to vol-map the density of the ligand molecule, (aspirin in
this case).  (using vmd!).
